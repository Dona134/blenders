```{r blenders}
install.packages("proxy", dependencies=TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(proxy)
```

I've created a .txt file with 4 blender types with some basic data from Amazon (I'm planning to buy one)

```{r}
blenders<-read.table("blenders.txt", header=TRUE)
```

```{r}
blenders
```

Performing gower similarity calculation simil function in the proxy library since we have both numeric and binary values (thus, can't use Jaccard/Euclidean distance)

```{r}
blenders_num<-blenders[,-1]
rownames(blenders_num)<-blenders$blenders
simil(blenders_num, method="gower")
```

We can see that The Kidisle and The Black Decker are the most similar, and the latter is the least similar to Shardor. Now let's graph the Dendrogram:

```{r}
h1<-hclust(dist(blenders_num, method="gower"))
plot(h1)
```
